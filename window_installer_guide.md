### Why is this flagged as potentially dangerous?

As we are a small team maintaining this application for a very specific target audience, we [did not sign our app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/signing-package-overview), and therefore not having the certificate that Microsoft (Windows) recognises. 
However, rest assured that your data is safe. Our full source code is availble online to show transparency in our product.
