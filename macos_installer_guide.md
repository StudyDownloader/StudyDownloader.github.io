### Why is this flagged as unverified?

As we are a small team maintaining this application for a very specific target audience, we do not have an Apple Developer Certificate, and therefore [did not notarize our app](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution).

However, rest assured that your data is safe. Our full source code is availble online to show transparency in our product.
